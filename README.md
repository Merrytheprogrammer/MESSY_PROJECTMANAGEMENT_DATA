Cleaning and analyzing a real-world project risk dataset using Python and pandas, with a focus on missing data handling and exploratory analysis.

## Data Cleaning Strategy

Standardized column names for consistency and reproducibility

Identified missing data patterns and applied decision-driven imputation

High-missing categorical features were preserved using an "Unknown" category

Medium-missing maturity-related features treated as informative signals

Verified data integrity (no duplicates, correct data types)
